# Familiar

> ⚠️
> 
> I'm currently moving from `tailwindcss` to `styled-components` so some components are not styled correctly and the code might be a litte messy.

## Introduction
Familiar is a webapp I'm developing for Lega Pauper Italia which main purpose is to improve the management of [Magic: the Gathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering) leagues organized in various regions of Italy (at the moment there are more than 20 active leagues, with about 30 regular players each). 
The platform will also have a public section where players can see a detailed view of each league event and its leaderboard.

## Roles

### Administrators  
- Create and edit leagues
- Define the beginning and the end of seasons
- Define a list of macrocategories of decks (specifying name, [archtype](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Archetype) and [color](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Color)) that will beavailable on the platform 

### Organizers 
- Subscribe or unsubscribe a player from their league
- Submit weekly event results
